## Overview

This app deploys pretrained **SelfReformer** model as a Supervisely Application for **Salient Instance Segmentation** tasks.

Models under a Salient Instance Segmentation task are usually used for separating foreground from background. They predict a mask for the foreground object. These models are class-agnostic, which means they can't predict a class label for an object.

The app is a serving App that allows you to apply the model to an image inside the Supervisely platform or beyond it (using the [Inference Session API](https://developer.supervisely.com/app-development/neural-network-integration/inference-api-tutorial)).


## Pretrained model

This SelfReformer model is trained on [DUTS-TR](http://saliencydetection.net/duts/) dataset and achieves a good performance on this task (see [authors Readme](https://github.com/BarCodeReader/SelfReformer) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11283) for technical details and benchmarks)

## How To Run

1. Start the application from Ecosystem
2. Open the app in your browser

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31512713/228268903-959167de-1097-437a-a609-c6c514803ff2.png" width="80%"/>

3. Select the model you want to deploy *(there is only one yet)*
4. Click **"SERVE"** button.
5. ✅ That's it! Now you can use other apps with your model.


## Inference Settings

- `bbox_padding`: (default `66%`) when applying the model to a crop of an image (ROI), this bbox_padding will expand the crop at the boundaries, getting more image context to the model (may lead to more accurate preditctions). The value can be measured either in pixels (e.g. `100px`) or in percentages (e.g. `10%`)
- `pixel_confidence_threshold`: (default `150`). The model predicts a "soft" masks, i.e. the mask values are in range 0-255, but the mask in Supervisely is a Bitmap and has only two values: 0-1 (one bit). With this threshold we will treat the pixels in the mask as **0** if they are below the **threshold** and as **1** if above.
